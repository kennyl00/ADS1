# __Autocomplete in C with Ternary Trees__ #

The Autocomplete program first loads all the data entries from a `datafile.csv` and forms a Ternary Tree. It then searches for the `prefix`, and displays all the matching entries to an `outputfile` and to the console. 
* Autocomplete1 does not sort the results
* Autocomplete2 sorts the results by using Selection Sort.

To run autocomplete1.c
```
make autocomplete1
./autocomplete1 [datafile.csv] [outputfile] [prefix]
```

To run autocomplete2.c 
```
make autocomplete2
./autocomplete2 [datafile.csv] [outputfile] [prefix]
```
