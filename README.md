# __Autocomplete in C with Ternary Trees__ #

The Autocomplete program first loads all the data entries and forms a Ternary Tree. It then searches for the prefix, and displays all the matching entries to an outputfile and the console. 
* Autocomplete1 displays both the results to the console and to an outputfile
* Autocomplete2 sorts the results by using Selection sort.

To run autocomplete1.c
```
make autocomplete1
./autocomplete1 [datafile.csv] [outputfilename.csv] [prefix]
```

To run autocomplete2.c 
```
make autocomplete2
./autocomplete2 [datafile.csv] [outputfilename.csv] [prefix]
```
